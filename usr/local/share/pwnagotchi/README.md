## Custom Plugins

# Deauth_Sniffer
- Don't just walk your pwny, let it see if anyone is working behind the scenes.

Displays message, logs, clears, alerts, etc...

# Quickdic_Throttled
- written because the normal quickdic either had to run on a 20 word list or crashed your RPI. this throttles the uploads, sorts your lists, and prioritizes the ones you select. you can adjust the speed and agression in the config.toml

# WPA3Parse
- use case, simply identifies, and creates a copy of those specific handshakes in it's own dir/file

# Ppisugar2
- This is almost the exact plugin from [tisboyo](https://github.com/tisboyo) I only updated the positioning and label so it better fit with the screen and plugins running.
