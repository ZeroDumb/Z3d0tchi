# project-pwny
Pwnagotchi plugins, code tweaks, configs, and more


I have built these all off of the [Jayofelony](https://github.com/jayofelony/pwnagotchi) img, additionally, I have tried to place these files in the same locations that they would go in your pwny. 

## Note: 

Your pwny may be different than mine, each has their own unique flavor. please make sure you know where to go and what you are updating. 

My config is for example only, if you use my config, your screen will imediately be different. I strongly urge that you make backup files of anything you have prior to using these pluggins, files, or configs.

## Extra Note:
