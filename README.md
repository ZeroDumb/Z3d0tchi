# project-pwny
A collection of plugins, config tweaks, and experimental code for curious Pwnagotchis.

This repo is built off the excellent work of [Jayofelony](https://github.com/jayofelony/pwnagotchi) and aims to expand it with additional features, enhancements, and chaos (of the lawful variety).

## How to Use
These files are organized to mirror where they'd typically go on your actual Pwnagotchi device. That said:

Your pwny may be different from mine.

Don't blindly overwrite stuff unless you're confident in what you're doing.

Always back up your configs before playing with new toys.

## Heads Up
If you apply my config as-is, your display will likely change immediately. Consider it a style opinion â€” not gospel.

## Use Your Brain
